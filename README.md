# Ray-Tracer
C program to draw spheres given input on x, y, z, origin, and color variables. Depth (z variable) missing from this implementation and will be added later with the introduction of lighting. File output redirected to a .ppm file - attached files are included but may be too large to view. A conversion to .jpg should fix this issue if a .ppm viewer is unavailable.
